            <h1> Who am i</h1>

            <p>my name is Henry i am 20 years old. I live in the netherlands in rotterdam. <br> My hobbys are badminton gaming and sleeping. There are some pro an cons about me <br> The pro about me is always try to learn something no matter if it hard to learn. I always try to be nice to other people . if my mood is shit i still try to be nice to other  .The cons is i am alot of time lazy and my discipline not that good one thing about my discipline is i always do things last moment <br> What i need to learn is i need to structer things more and plan everything out and dont say oh i will do it later that is one of my weaknesses. I always think i will do it later and the i wont do it later because i am doing more fun things, what i enjoy more 
                for instance if i am gaming at home i wont stop playing because i have way to much fun and when i need to study it feel like i dont have any concentration because i am thinking about something else like a game or something that i like. <br> And a few month a go i didnt feel well everyday every morning i had a headache felt a alot of time sick. I had time that i didnt know  what to do anything just laying in bed and doing nothing and just be lonley i felt so empty that time i thought so wrong about things i want to sucide have decide to not do it because i know i have family around me that always wanted to help me out whatever happen with me. i am so gratefull to have so many people around me that always trying to help me whatever happen with me even tho i was happy or sad. Alot of times i just faked a smile even tho i wasnt happy afterall always trying to smile. What i learned in these 2 years is always to try find some help from a family or some one else before u do stupid thing what u will regret about it. And now i am trying to pick things up like plan everything out and have a beter life and be happy To my Future self stop being lazy and just keep going no matter what wil happen  being yourself even tho people will talk about u behind your back just dont give a fuck about it let them talk they only try to hurt u but sometimes u dont need give them attention  and just be yourself. One day u will realise that u have done some stupid things and some are the right way and u will learn about what the real world is. <br> <strong> If u will read this later when u older PLEASE BEING YOUR SELF AND DONT CHANGE BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE TELL U TO CHANGE BEING BE YOUR SELF IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING.
                you will face many defeats in life, but never let yourself be defeated </strong></p>
